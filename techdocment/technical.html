        <p>It is a web based comparison application where a user can do comparison of five different cloud service
          providers on basis of storage and there pricing, two type of price comparison can be done by using this
          application</p>
        <li class="intro_li">Pay per use</li>
        <li class="intro_li">Pas as you go</li>
        <li class="intro_li">Price in detail comparison</li>
        <p>Dynamic fetching is also done the data table in the database regarding to prices of cloud service providers
          are updated by searching the data on the service provider’s website at runtime. Price comparison regarding to
          different cloud service provider will be performed and best cloud service provider will be suggested to the
          user at the top. And also SLA’s (service level agreement) of different cloud service providers are available
          on our website.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In this chapter it will discuss complete detail of our project and which format I have used to complete the
          documentation of my project; here in this chapter I will also explain functional and non-functional
          requirements, design and implementation constraints of my project.
        </p>
        <h2>Product Scope</h2>
        <p>
          This is a web based comparison application which will compare cloud service providers on basis of their
          storage pricing on individual and enterprise level. Application will suggest best cloud service provider to
          user. Comparison can be done on the basis of both storage and price.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this application is to provide user best cloud service provider as there are too many cloud
          service providers in the market but people do not know which one is the best and which will serve them
          according to their needs and requirements. To overcome this hurdle and to make their selection easy we are
          developing this application.

        <h2>Use case Diagram</h2>
        <p>
          An Actor is the major part of use case diagram because actor is an entity who is interacting with the system,
          an actor can be human, system or machine. In our use case diagram “user” is the actor and he is interacting
          with system, this user is a primary actor. This user is primary actor because he is asking for the services
          from system, user is having goal to do comparison of different cloud service providers so our system is
          providing service to the user and our system will fulfill the user requirement because it is designed to
          provide service to user.
        </p>
        <h2>Class Diagram</h2>
        <p>
          A class diagram is the collection of classes which tells the relationship and source code dependencies among
          the classes, a class in a class diagram tells us the methods and objects used in a class. It shows us the
          complete structure of system that how system works in different situation. It also tells us the relationship
          among the objects. There are three portions of a class in class diagram, first one is containing the name of
          the class and in second is having the attributes of that specific class and third one contains the operations
          which a class can execute.

      <p>
        Testing is a process of checking the correction of system functionality against requirements. In this chapter
        testing and result analysis in described. This chapter gives a detailed view of how the software is tested and
        what result we got.
      </p>
      <h2>Testing Activities</h2>
      <p>There are different activities contain the process of testing shown in the fig below.
        <li class="intro_li">Identify the objectives for which testing is performed.</li>
        <li class="intro_li">Then select inputs for your test cases.</li>
        <li class="intro_li">Now calculate the expected outcome with yourself.</li>
        <li class="intro_li">So, the next step is to set an environment in which the test cases are performed.</li>
        <li class="intro_li">Execute the program on the basis of selected outputs.</li>
        <li class="intro_li">Then, in the last analyses your outcomes and match with the expected outcomes.</li>

      <article>
        <p> You can declare the variables by following methods:
          <div class="forcode">
            <code>var x = 42.</code>
            <code>let x = 42.</code>
            <code> x = 42.</code>
            <code>const x = 42.</code>
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>Some javascript code of "Hello World"</p>
        <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
              alert("Hello" + yourName);
              }
              greetMe("World");
